# output 9 in the interpreter, using only the number 3 and any math operators you want(eg: +, -, *, / )
# print(3*3)

# output number 5 in the interpreter, using only the nubmer 3 and any math operator you want
# print((3+3) - (3/3))

#define a variable called "x" with the value 8
x = 8

# defined a variable called "y " with the value 3
y = 3

# define a variable called z with the value 5, using x and y instead of the number 5
z = x - y
