## Data types has 3 main category
1. numerical
data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:
i. discrete data: numbers that are limited to integer
ii. continuous data: numbers that are inifinite value.

2. categorical
data are values that can not be measured up against each other. example: a color value, or yes/no values.

3. Ordinal
data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. example: school grades where A is better tha B

## Mean, Median, Mode
1. Mean: the average value
2. Median: the mid point value
3. Mode: most common value

## Standard Deviation
is a number that describe how spread out the values are. 
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean value.
A hisgh standard deviation means that the value are spread out over a wider range.

## Variance
is another number that indicates how spread out the values are. 
In fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard deviation
Or the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the variance
-- to calculate variance you have to do as follows:
1. calculate mean
2. for each value: find the difference from the mean
3. for each difference: find the square value
4. the variance is the average number of these squared difference
